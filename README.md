# ModSHO
PCB for the [ModXO Xbox hardmod by Shalx](https://github.com/shalxmva/modxo). Designed for manufacturability and minor customizability. See [BOM.md] for the Bill of Materials.

The build takes heavy inspiration from [m4x10187's Adapter](https://github.com/m4x10187/Modxo_RP2040_Zero_Adapter).
